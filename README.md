#RecipeNet

Our attempt to provide a web interface to a Character Recurrent Neural Network which had been trained on a few of desert recipes. Results aren't really what we wanted, but it works so YAY!

Model built using Keras, is overfitting, need to add drop-out.
Built during a Hackathon, hope this explains why it's messy.
