In a 
Add the rice and orange zest and cook for one minute.
Reserve one cup of stock and pour the rest into the pot. Mixture will bubble.
Bring to a boil, lower heat to low, cover and cook covered for just ten minutes.
While rice is cooking, whip the two eggs until frothy and add to the cup of reserved stock.
Then add the juice from the orange, lemon and lime and stir. Set this aside.
After ten minutes, remove lid and add the cooked chicken, green peas and cilantro and heat to hot, almost boiling.
Remove from heat and ladle out a few cups of hot broth into the egg and juice mixture to temper it. Then slowly add this mixture back into the hot soup, stirring while you add.
Heat the soup just until serving temperature and remove from heat.
Add optional hot sauce if desired.
Serve with chopped cilantro and scallion tops.


In a 5-6 quart Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, heat two tablespoons of the oil over medium high heat.
Once hot, add sausage meat and break up with a wooden spoon while browning, about 3-4 minutes.
Move the sausage meat to the sides and add the remaining oil along with the leeks, celery and carrots. Stir and cook until the leeks begin to soften, about 2-3 more minutes.
Add in the chopped kale and stir the entire mixture and cook to wilt the kale, about another 2 minutes.
Add in the tomato paste and stir into the mixture. Reduce to medium and cook this for 2 more minutes.
Add the lentils, diced tomatoes and the stock and raise the heat to high.
Bring to a boil, cover and lower to the lowest heat.
Cook covered for 35-45 minutes or until the lentils are soft. Be careful not to overcook the lentils. They should still have a little chew.
Season with the salt and pepper and taste. Season more if needed.
Use a small ladle or soup spoon and remove any fat that floats to the top and discard. (We removed about a half cup of fat.)
This final step is optional but advised. Puree some of the soup but not all by either placing some in a blender or use an immersion blender and puree for a few seconds. This will give the soup a nice creamy texture but still have plenty of body.


In a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, sauté onions and celery in half of the olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.
Push vegetables to sides of pot, increase heat to medium high and place the rest of the olive oil in center. Add beef and break up with wooden spoon and sauté until beef is cooked.
Return to medium heat and add tomato paste. Mix in the paste and cook for one more minute.
Add diced tomato, brown stock, dried thyme and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Skim off any fat and foam that floats to the top.
Increase heat to medium high and add spinach and parmesan. Cook for five more minutes.
Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
Cook pasta according to box directions.
Place pasta in serving bowl, ladle in soup and top with more Parmesan cheese.


The day before serving this soup, prepare the stock by placing all ingredients into a large stock pot and bringing up to heat gradually. Boil then reduce to a simmer and simmer for 8 hours. If the mixture gets too thick and it looks like it might stick, add more water. I added one more quart of water at about 6 hours. After 8 hours, strain out the stock and cool and discard all solids. Refrigerate overnight.
The next day skim off and discard the fat that floats to the top.
Place the stock in the pot along with all of the soup ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer on a low boil for 10-15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
Season if needed and serve.


In a large 5 - 6 quart Dutch oven, heat oil over high.

Raise the heat to high then once bubbling, reduce to low and cook partially covered for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t stick.
Remove four whole pieces of Kielbasa to your cutting board.
Remove and discard bay leaf.
Add the prunes and simmer ten minutes.
Slice the kielbasa into bite sized slices and add back to pot and serve in bowls with the rye bread.
Store leftovers in the refrigerator. Great reheated the next day.


If using uncooked squash, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. (If using leftover cooked squash, skip to step 3.)
Peel and seed the squash, cut in half top to bottom, brush with oil, salt and pepper and roast on a foil lined pan until soft, about 45 minutes to an hour.

Simmer over medium heat until the vegetables are tender, about ten to fifteen more minutes, stirring often.
Cut the two baked potatoes in half the long way and scoop out the potato from the skin and add to the soup. These skins will be fried later and served with the soup so leave a little of the potato with the skin. Cut the skin again lengthwise to get eight strips per potato, 16 total hearty strips. Set those aside.
Remove half of the soup and puree, then add back into the soup pot. Or remove half and using an immersion blender, puree the soup in the pot then add the other half back in. Basically you need to puree half the soup.
Add the cream and remove from the heat.
In a cast iron skillet, heat the light oil to 350 degrees F and fry the potato skins until crisp, transferring to a paper towel to drain.
To serve, place hot soup into each bowl, top with cheddar, sour cream, reserved bacon, sliced scallion tops and potato skins on the side.


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Snap the stem off each squash and when inverted, if the squash does not sit flat, trim a little off until it does. Do this for the bottom as well. Cut each squash in half on the horizon and remove and discard seeds.
Line a 9x13-inch pan with foil and place each squash half face up. Divide salt, pepper, allspice and butter between the six halves.
Cover the pan with foil and bake until almost fork tender, about one hour. The squash should be almost tender. The flesh will be removed in another step and cooked further.

Heat the pot to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes or until squash is tender.
Using an immersion blender, puree to smooth.
If you are using the optional garnishes, fry the sage leaves in a thin sheen of hot oil on both sides to crisp and remove to a paper towel. Mince the candied ginger then sprinkle both on top of each serving.


Start by making the stock. Add all stock ingredients to a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for two hours. Strain stock and pick meat from bone. Discard the rest. This step can be done in advance and the stock frozen until needed. Cool and freeze in zip lock gallon bags.

In a medium sauce pan, heat two tablespoons of butter over medium heat and add shallots and whole sprigs of rosemary.
Cook over medium for 10-15 minutes until shallots are caramelized.
Add heavy and light cream, bring to a slight simmer and cook 10 more minutes, never letting the mixture boil. Use a thermometer and don’t let the temperature rise above 170 degrees F. If it does, remove from the heat to bring the temperature down.
Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and strain the cream mixture. Discard the solids.
In a medium soup pot, melt the remaining butter over medium heat and add the potatoes and parsnips. Stir and cook for five to ten minutes or until the vegetables are tender but not over cooked.

Slowly add the cream mixture, stirring as you add and return to a slow simmer.
Add Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper and stir.
Pour the oyster liquor through a strainer and into the stew, stopping just as you get to the sediment at the bottom of the bowl. Discard that sediment.
Bring the mixture to a slow simmer and taste. Season as needed. (I can tell you that Chef Jeff Cruff developed this recipe to be perfectly seasoned as is.)
One minute before serving, add shucked oysters, simmer one minute then serve immediately with oyster crackers.


In a large 8 quart heavy bottomed stock pot, heat butter over high heat and add mushrooms. Cook five minutes then remove to a bowl and set aside.

After 30 minutes, stir in chopped cilantro and serve with garnishes of sliced olives and chopped scallions.


Place stock in a large pot.
If using baby bok choy, cut into bite sized pieces and place all in with stock. If using regular bok choy, cut leaves and a little of the tops of the stalks into bite sized pieces. Discard bottoms or save for another recipe.
Place remaining ingredients into the pot and bring to a boil. Boil gently for three minutes, then turn off heat.
Let sit for five minutes, then serve. (Told you it was simple.)


Place pork ribs in a large 8 quart heavy pot and cover the ribs with water almost to the top. Bring to a boil uncovered, lower to a fast simmer (low boil) and cook for 45 minutes, skimming off foam as they start to boil. Shut off burner and let them sit in the water for 15 minutes.
While the pork is cooking, in a medium frying pan, cook the 
Once cooked, remove ribs from the pot and let cool. Save the liquid in the pot.
To the pot of liquid, add the sauerkraut and juice, shredded cabbage, stewed tomatoes, caraway seeds and salt as well as the cooked salt pork and onion mixture.
Cook over medium high heat until cabbage is cooked, approximately 30-35 minutes. While the cabbage mixture is cooking, remove the meat from the bones, shredding the meat into bite-sized pieces. Return the cooked pork to the pot once the cabbage is tender and heat to serving temperature.
Peel and quarter potatoes and place in cold sated water while cabbage mixture is cooking. Bring to a boil and over a medium boil, cook potatoes for 5-10 minutes or until tender. Drain water and cool potatoes to room temperature. Once the cabbage mixture has finished cooking, cut cooked potatoes into bite sized pieces and either add to the finished cabbage dish or serve on the side. (cooking in quarters and cutting after the fact will make them more firm and less mushy since less of the surface touched the boiling water.
Serve with rye bread and butter for a traditional Polish meal.

Using an 
To serve as cream of chicken soup, add enough whole milk or light cream or both to reach desired consistency.
Or use as-is in recipes calling for condensed cream of chicken soup.
Or freeze in zip lock bags. The mixture freezes very well as long as you have squeezed all of the air out before zipping up the bag and have not yet added milk or cream. Just thaw as needed for recipes calling for condensed cream of chicken soup.


Dredge the veal pieces in a half cup of the flour, salt and pepper.

Heat the pot with the bacon fat to medium high and once hot, sear meat in three or four batches. Do not over crowd pan and sear each side for three to four minutes. Remove to bowl with bacon and onions as you sear each batch. The searing process should take 30-40 minutes total. Don’t rush this step; just make sure each piece is nice and golden brown.
Once the last batch is done, pour the bowl back in the pot and add the white wine. Stir to get all brown bits from bottom of pot.
Add carrots, apples, apple sauce, one can of stock and bay leaves. Bring to boil, lower to a simmer, and place cover partially on. Simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally.
After two hours, add second can of stock and the potatoes and bring to a rolling simmer. Cook five minutes then add squash and cook for an additional 15 minutes. (Be careful at this point as the mixture will be thick and if not watched, may stick and burn). The pork is very tender so as you stir, try not to break the meat up too much.
Once the potatoes and squash are cooked, serve stew in bowls.


Bring a large pot of water to a boil and plunge in live lobsters. Boil for 12 minutes then remove to an ice bath.
Once lobsters are cool enough to touch, remove meat from claws and tail draining any liquid from the lobsters into a bowl. Cut the meat into bite sized pieces, add to the bowl with the liquid and refrigerate until later in recipe.
Open up body cavities and rinse out any of the green tomalley if present.
Place all shells and body on a large cutting board, cover with a dish towel and break and crush the shells with a rolling pin or mallet. Alternatively you can place everything in a food processor and pulse a few times to break up the shells but the cutting board method is easier, for me anyway.

Add pickles, cooked potatoes and pickle juice and heat just to serving temperature but do not boil.
Garnish with uncooked pickle slices, optional.


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Dice the squash or pumpkin into ¾ inch pieces. Place six cups in a medium bowl and reserve the rest.
Top the squash in the bowl with the oil, salt and pepper and toss to coat. Pour out onto a sheet pan and roast for 20 minutes or until tender. Reserve for later.
While squash is roasting, melt butter in a large heavy bottomed pot or Dutch oven and add garlic, onions, celery and carrots and sauté over medium high for five minutes. Add reserved raw squash and sauté for another five minutes.
Add stock, sage, and nutmeg and bring to a boil. Reduce to a fast simmer and cook for 40 minutes, making sure it does not stick to the bottom while cooking.

In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the diced zucchini and sauté 5 to 7 minutes or until just tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the zucchini to a large, heavy-bottomed dutch oven.
In the same skillet you used to sauté the zucchini (there should be enough oil remaining in the pan, but if not add up to ¼ cup more olive oil) sauté onions, garlic and bell peppers for about 10 minutes or until just wilted. Pour the entire mixture into the dutch oven with the zucchini.
Heat the dutch oven over low heat and add both kinds of canned tomatoes (including juices), fresh tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, basil, oregano, black pepper, salt, fennel seeds and fresh chopped parsley. Simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid any sticking on the bottom of the pan.
After the 30 mintues are up, add the kidney beans, garbanzo beans, chopped dill and lemon juice and cook for another 15 minutes. Stir well and adjust seasonings as needed to suit your tastes.
Serve hot with sour cream, shredded Monterey Jack cheese and sliced scallions sprinkled on top.


Husk corn and remove all of the silk. Using a sharp knife, remove corn kernels and set aside. (

Serve with some nice crusty Italian bread.


In a large pot place lamb and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and discard water. This will remove all impurities from the finished stock.
Place lamb back in pot with all other stock ingredients, bring to a boil then simmer for 2 ½ hours uncovered. Cool and strain. Remove meat from other solids and discard solids. You should be left with about 5 or 6 cups of stock and about a pound or so of meat. A little more or less is fine. Let fat rise to top, skim off and discard all but one tablespoon of fat. Reserve that tablespoon for the soup.
Place the tablespoon of fat back into the pot along with two tablespoons of olive oil and add onions and garlic. Cook over medium high for four minutes and add mushrooms.

Roast for 15 more minutes. Turn again and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes being careful that nothing burns or sticks to bottom. Add a little more butter if needed towards the end. The potatoes should be tender and the onion not quite tender.
While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the potato for garnish by cutting thin waffle slices using a mandolin. Fry in 375 degree vegetable oil and set aside to drain. This step is optional.
Remove the pan from the oven and pour in some of the broth to deglaze the pan. Using the heavy spatula scrape everything from the bottom.
Pour entire contents of pan into a large pot along with remaining broth, water, Worcestershire sauce and rosemary. Cover and bring to a boil then simmer for 25 minutes.
Remove and discard rosemary.
With an emersion blender, puree mixture until completely smooth. At this point, if the soup is thick and creamy, cook no further. If it is still a bit loose, simmer for up to 15 minutes until the mixture is very thick. Ours was perfect without the additional cooking time.
Add cream and salt and pepper to taste.
To serve, place soup in bowl and top with a dollop of Crème Fraiche. Then sprinkle the chopped chives and finish with a few cooked waffle cut fried potatoes.


Place all stock ingredients into a large pot, bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for four hours.

Add cream and heat just until hot but not boiling.
Add white fish and stir once, then remove from heat. Try to leave fish in large pieces.
To serve, place chowder in bowl and top with slices of smoked salmon and garnish with fresh dill.


To slice the onions, cut off root and stem end then cut in half vertically. Cut each half in half again, cutting vertically so you have four thick slices. Now cut slices, staying with the grain, about ¼ to ½ inch thick.
In a large heavy bottomed pot such as a Dutch oven, melt butter and oil over medium low heat. Add onions and stir once. Do not touch again for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, stir and do not touch again for another 15 minutes.
Move heat to medium and cook 15 or more minutes until onions are nice and browned and caramelized. Watch closely at this point so they do not get too dark or stick to the bottom. Add a little water if they are sticking.
While onions are cooking, place parsley stems, dried thyme leaves, dried tarragon leaves and the bay leaf onto cheese cloth. Wrap tightly and tie with a string. Hold for later.
Add garlic to onions and cook for one minute.
Add brandy and cook to evaporate.
Add stock and herb bag. Cover loosely and simmer for 45 minutes.
Add salt and pepper as needed.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place oven proof bowls or crocks into a baking pan and pour hot tap water about half way up outsides of bowls.

Cook pasta in boiling water for ten minutes, drain but do not rinse.
Remove three tablespoons of cold stock and place in a medium bowl. In a medium pot, bring remaining stock to a boil and reduce down to 1 ½ quarts.
While stock is reducing and pasta is cooking, shred turkey with your fingers into bite sized shreds.
In the bowl with cool stock, add eggs, salt and half the Parmesan along with the chopped parsley. Beat for three minutes by hand with a whip or use an electric mixer.
Once stock has reduced, add egg mixture a little at a time while you whip stock. The eggs will separate which is what you want.
Add cooked pasta and cooked turkey and heat and simmer for five minutes.
Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.


In a large pot, heat pancetta and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat until pancetta is crisp, five to ten minutes.

Add a few ladles full of the soup to the cooked butter and flour and stir to form a thick mixture then pour this into the soup and stir.
Add heavy cream, stir and check for seasoning.
If you purchased raw pumpkin seeds, place them in a dry pan and heat over medium high for five or so minutes to toast.
Serve soup with toasted pumpkin seeds.


If using fresh tomatoes: The skins of plum tomatoes cook down enough in this soup so that you don’t need to peel them but you do need to remove the seeds as they will make the soup bitter. The easiest method is to have two bowls, one with a strainer. If you are using plum tomatoes, nip off the end and cut in half lengthwise. Then with your thumb or index finger, scrape the seeds from each half into the bowl with the strainer. If cutting larger round tomatoes, cut out core and cut them horizontally. Then over the bowl with the strainer, reach up and scrape out all the seeds. Throw the cleaned tomatoes into the bowl without the strainer. Finally move the seeds around the strainer to get out any last bit of juice and discard seeds. Take the liquid left in the bowl and add to the tomato halves. With three pounds of tomatoes, you should end up with a little over 2 pounds of cut up tomatoes (weighed on a scale). This is equal to about six to eight cups (a little more or less is fine).
In a medium to large Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, add olive oil, onions, carrots, celery, garlic and bay leaves. Cook over medium high for five minutes. Add tomato halves with juice (or canned).
Add half of the fresh cut up basil. Tie whole thyme and whole parsley together with twine and place in pot.
Add broth, tomato juice, sugar, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer, cover and cook 30 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaves, thyme and parsley.
Add second half of basil to the soup. Stir in pepper flakes and butter. With an immersion blender, blend soup until completely pureed.
At this point, if you like it very thick, add the remaining two tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for another few minutes. If you like it thinner, omit the last two tablespoons.
Also adding cream is optional as a personal preference. We left it out.


In a large (5-quart+) slow cooker, pour in the olive oil and tip to coat the bottom of the slow cooker insert.
Add all of the other ingredients – EXCEPT the salt and the pesto – to the slow cooker and stir to combine.
Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on low for 8 hours.
After 8 hours, remove the lid and stir the soup. Place half of the soup into a blender and process until smooth (leave the other half in the slow cooker). Pour the pureed soup back into the slow cooker with the un-pureed soup and stir to combine.
Stir in the pesto plus 1 teaspoon salt and stir again to combine. Add additional salt and pepper to taste if desired.


Remove the meat from the rotisserie chicken and dice into bite sized pieces. (One two-pound cooked rotisserie chicken will yield about one pound of usable meat, equivalent to about three cups of diced cooked chicken.)
In a medium pot over medium high heat, melt butter and add carrots, onion, celery, parsley, pepper, thyme and garlic powder. Stir and cook for 5 minutes. Lower heat to medium and add flour. Stir and cook for three more minutes.
Add stock and stir with wooden spoon until combined. Add cooked chicken and stir. Reduce temperature to low.
Bring a medium pan of water to a boil and place two bags of Success rice into water and follow directions on box (or follow microwave directions on box).
When rice is almost done, heat soup back up and add peas and cream and stir. Taste and only add salt if needed. Depending on the brand of stock you buy, salt may not be needed.
Once rice is done, follow box directions to remove and drain and add rice to soup.
Stir and serve.


Put everything into a large stock pot and cover with water. Slowly bring to a boil, skimming off any scum that floats to the top. Lower heat to a really low simmer and cook for four hours uncovered.
Once done, strain and cool, discarding solids. When completely cool, remove fat and discard. Use immediately or freeze in zipper seal bags. Reboil when ready to use.


In a medium to large Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, slowly bring up the oil to a medium heat and add the garlic. Sauté for just one minute and add the tomatoes, basil and pepper. Cook for five minutes over a medium heat then add the salt.
Add the brodo, bring up to hot and cook just a few minutes longer. Add the bread, stir and cover. Cook ten minutes covered over very low heat.
Remove the soup from the heat and serve immediately with olive oil drizzled over each bowl along with freshly grated Parmesano Reggiano.


In a heavy bottomed pot or Dutch oven, sauté onions in oil over medium high heat for three minutes. Add garlic and sauté for one minute. Add chourico and sauté for two minutes. Reduce to medium and add tomato paste and kale and sauté for five minutes, stirring frequently so it does not stick or burn.
Add stock, water, salt, pepper, bay, gravy color, optional parsley and optional mint and bring to a boil. Reduce to a fast simmer and cook for five minutes. Add cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until tender, 5-10 minutes.
Add drained beans, bring to hot, adjust seasonings and serve with crusty bread.


Place the potatoes and the parsnips in a bowl and cover with cold water. Do not discard the water.
In a large Dutch oven, sauté pancetta in olive oil over medium heat until browned and crispy, about ten minutes. Add leeks, onions, thyme, salt and pepper and stir. Cook over medium to medium high heat for three minutes. Add one tablespoon of flour and cook for one minute.
Add clam juice and stir. Then add all of stock and measure out and add one cup of the water that the parsnips and potatoes have been sitting in. Stir to combine.
Save the rest of the potato water in case you like the chowder thinner, otherwise discard rest of water. Add the potatoes and parsnips to the pot and bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and simmer for ten to fifteen minutes or until vegetables are tender.
While vegetables are cooking, melt butter in a small pan and once melted, add remaining two tablespoons of flour. Cook over medium heat for about three to five minutes or until the mixture no longer smells raw. (This is called a roux and should smell like cooked chestnuts when done. The longer you cook a roux, the darker the sauce or soup will be.) Set aside.
Once vegetables are tender, add the roux and stir to thicken. Then add milk and cream and bring only to hot and not boiling so the cream does not separate. Add in the raw cubed salmon and just bring to serving temperature and remove from heat. Try not to break up the salmon as you stir. If you prefer thinner chowder, add a little more of the potato water and heat to serving temperature.
To serve, top each bowl with smoked salmon (optional).




In a medium to large heavy bottomed pot, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add onions, bell pepper, and jalapeños and sauté for three minutes.
Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Cook for one more minute.
Add ground beef breaking beef up with wooden spoon. Cook until the beef is no longer pink.
Add tomatoes and stir. Reduce to medium low and cook uncovered for 30 minutes stirring occasionally. Add beans and bring back to serving temperature.
Add additional cumin, chili powder, salt or pepper if needed, and serve with shredded cheddar cheese on top.


In a four quart slow cooker, place stock, tomatoes, cheese rinds, bay leaf, basil and thyme. Turn your slow cooker on, setting the timer on high for four hours or low for six hours, and cover the mixture (this will allow your slow cooker to start heating up).
While the slow cooker starts to heat up, in a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add celery, onions and carrots and cook for three to four minutes until almost soft. Add garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and pepper flakes and cook for one more minute. Add tomato paste and cook for about two minutes (being careful not to burn), then add wine to deglaze the skillet. Pour this mixture into slow cooker and stir to mix. Cover again and allow to cook for four to six hours.
After the cooking time is up, remove cheese rinds and bay leaf and discard. With an 
Turn the slow cooker to high (if it isn't already), then add frozen tortellini. Cook until they are fully cooked (approximately 10 minutes), then add spinach. Continue cooking just until spinach has wilted into the soup (only a minute or two). If soup is too thick, dilute with more cream or more vegetable stock.




In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, melt turkey fat or butter with olive oil. Add raw onions, leeks, garlic, carrots, celery and parsnips. Stir and cook for five minutes. Add white wine and deglaze pan. Add spinach, green beans, stock, salt, pepper and savory and stir. Turn off burner and hold.
In a large bowl, place bread and milk. Mush together until the bread is soaked. Then squeeze out and discard any milk left after squeezing. Add potatoes, onions, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, marjoram, beaten eggs and only enough bread crumbs to bind the mixture. The mixture should be soft but firm enough to roll in your hands and keep its shape. Divide the mixture into 24 even balls and roll round.
Clean out the bowl and add the flour. Roll the dumplings in the four to coat all sides.
Return heat to soup and bring to a boil. Drop in the dumplings, cover the pot and bring back to a boil. When the soup starts to boil, use a wooden spoon or spatula to make sure dumplings are not sticking to bottom. Then cover the pot, bring to a simmer and cook 15 minutes.
Remove lid, add cooked turkey and stir. If you were using leftover cooked vegetables instead of fresh, add them now. Bring the soup up to serving temperature and serve three dumplings per person in a large bowl with a few ladles of the soup over.
Note: Alternatively, you can cook the dumplings separately by dropping them into boiling water for 15 minutes, again making sure they don’t stick to the pot bottom. Then serve with soup that has been cooking at the same time.


Place all ingredients into a large stock pot and slowly bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer for three hours. Skim foam that rises to the top as it cooks. Depending on the type and amount of the bones and meat you started with, you may need to simmer longer (up to four hours if needed) to intensify flavors.
Strain the stock and discard the solids except for the meat.
Remove skin and debone the turkey and reserve. Use for any recipe that calls for cooked turkey meat (such as our 
Cool the stock completely.
Once cooled, skim off the fat that settles on the top and if desired, save for any poultry recipe that calls for butter. (Turkey fat is full of flavor and lasts fairly long in the refrigerator and can also be frozen.)
Use stock for any recipe that calls for turkey stock like our 


In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, sauté pancetta in olive oil until browned, about 4-5 minutes. Add carrots, onions, leeks and bell pepper and sauté 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for one more minute. Add green tomatoes, lentils, broth, bay leaves, salt, pepper, cilantro, sriracha and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer uncovered 20 minutes stirring occasionally.

Once the mixture comes to a boil, lower to a medium but brisk boil and cook uncovered stirring occasionally for 10-12 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Remove pot from the heat and add cream. Stir to combine and serve with toasted Ciabatta bread spread with a little butter.


In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, over medium-high heat, cook the sausage and fresh sage – breaking up the pieces of sausage as it cooks into small, bite-sized pieces. Cook the pork completely through until browned and no pink remains. Drain the excess fat, leaving the cooked pork and sage in the saucepan.
Add the beans, squash, salsa and water to the saucepan with the cooked sausage and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Once the chili comes to a boil, lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes (again stirring frequently) until the chili thickens.
Ladle the chili into individual bowls and sprinkle with goat cheese. Serve immediately.


Cut the cucumber, peppers, tomatoes and onion into 1-inch cubes.
In a food processor, pulse the cucumber until coarsely chopped. (Do not over-process – you want some texture from the vegetables in your finished gazpacho.) Pour the chopped cucumber into a very large bowl.
Repeat this process for each vegetable – separately chopping the peppers until coarse, then the tomatoes, then the onion – and pour each processed vegetable into the same large bowl.
Add the garlic, tomato juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper. Mix well.
Take about 3 cups of the mixture and pour it back into the food processor. Process until pureed. Pour the pureed mixture back into the bowl and mix again. Note: This step is optional – you can leave your gazpacho chunky if you like. We prefer ours slightly more pureed – but not completely processed.
Chill in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.
When ready to serve, spoon into a soup bowl and add a dollop of sour cream for garnish (optional).


Place 
Add onions, peppers and celery and sauté three to five minutes or until celery is tender. Add garlic and sauté one more minute.

Taste and adjust seasoning then add the fish. Gently stir and cook over medium heat for about two to three minutes or until fish is cooked through. Do not stir too much or you will break apart the fish.


In a pan large enough to hold the clams, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add clams and cover the pot. Cook over medium high heat for 7-9 minutes. If any clams don’t open, discard. Remove clams from broth and transfer to a sheet tray. Reserve the broth. Strain through a fine sieve lined with a coffee filter or cheese cloth. Strain a few times to remove all traces of sand.
Remove the clams from the shells. With a sharp knife, cut meat around belly and reserve. Then split the bellies lengthwise and scrape out and discard the contents. Cut bellies and add to the reserved chopped clams. Discard shells.
In a large heavy bottomed pot over medium heat, cook 
Add celery, onions, garlic and half the potatoes and cook for about ten minutes or until onions are translucent. Stir often. Add flour and cook for another minute.
Add 3 cups of reserved broth, the rest of the potatoes, thyme and bay leaf and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10-15 minutes..
Once potatoes are tender, remove the pot from the heat, discard bay leaf and add chopped clams and cream. (If you are making this ahead of time, do not add the cream until you are ready to heat and serve.)
Season chowder with pepper as needed and heat to serving temperature. Depending on how briny the clams are and since this recipe used salt pork, you may not need to put in additional salt.
Serve with a dollop of butter over each portion and oyster crackers on the side.

In a large stock pot, place chicken bones or hens, fryer, feet or necks or turkey wing and chicken wings. Fill with just enough hot water to cover. Quickly boil and simmer for five minutes. Strain and discard the water – this will remove most of the impurities from the stock.
Wash the stock pot and return chicken products back to pot.
Place all other ingredients in with the chicken and fill with 1 ½ gallons of cold water.
Slowly bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer for 4 hours, skimming occasionally.
Once the stock has simmered and reduced, strain and reserve stock for Asian recipes.
Stock may be frozen. (We use zip lock bags to freeze the stock and thaw out the stock as needed).
Pick the meat from the whole fryer and save for soup or other dishes. Discard all other solids.


Place potatoes in a medium pot with a pinch of salt and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes or until tender. Drain and set potatoes aside.

Add all other ingredients except salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Bring to a simmer and cook for one hour and 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.


Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Pour 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of the oil into a large roasting pan and place into the oven. Let the pan get hot in the oven for about ten minutes.
While pan and oil is in the oven getting hot, mix the V-8 with half of the tomato paste and slather all over the meat and bones.
Open oven and place meat and bones into hot roasting pan. Cook for 30-45 minutes until bones are deep brown. Open oven occasionally and turn bones. Watch during the last 15 minutes of the roasting time to make sure they don’t burn.
Remove from oven and place in a 10-quart stock pot. Cover with six quarts of cold water and bring to boil.
While pot is coming to a boil, pour remaining one quart of water into roasting pan and heat on the stove top to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any brown bits and pour into stock pot.
Once stock comes to a boil, reduce to a simmer and skim off any scum that floats to the top. Simmer for 5 hours, skimming occasionally.
While the stock is simmering, place a 14” heavy bottomed skillet on the stove top along with the other half of the oil and heat over medium high.
Place carrots, onions, celery and celery tops (if used) in the hot oil. Sauté for 15-20 minutes until the onions are nice and browned.
Add in the remaining tomato paste and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Add a few ladles of the stock to loosen up the mixture and to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom. Let cool and then set this mixture aside in the refrigerator.
After the stock has simmered for the full 5 hours, place the carrot and onion mixture into the stock along with the parsley, thyme, peppercorns, bay leaf, garlic and salt.
Bring back to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for an additional hour.
Strain the stock back into the stock pot. If you can salvage any beef from the steak and bones, do so and use in your soup recipes, otherwise discard the solids.
This stock may be used in any recipe calling for beef stock, beef broth or brown stock. Before using, however, it is a good idea to skim any fat from the stock.
The best way to cool your stock before refrigerating, is to fill your kitchen sink half full with ice water and set the pot with the strained stock into the sink. This will cool the stock down quickly. You may need to change the ice water a few times, but you can get the stock down in temperature pretty quickly using this method. Stir occasionally to distribute the heat. Then refrigerate and remove fat after the stock cools, usually overnight.
This stock freezes well in small zipper seal plastic bags.

Note: With this recipe, the type of meat used will determine your cooking time. If you are using a tough cut of beef, the recipe will use both quarts of water and take 2 ½ hours. If you are using a higher quality cut of beef, only one quart of water will be needed and the cooking time will be less. If you are not sure, save one quart of water and add it towards the end if too much liquid has evaporated. I suggest using a chuck roast as the meat of choice for beef stew.
Mix flour, salt and pepper together in a bowl. Dredge beef cubes in flour and remove, shaking off excess flour.
Over medium high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of oil in 6 quart heavy bottomed stock pot until slightly brown and frothy. Place half of the beef in the hot fat making sure that meat pieces do not touch each other. Cook 2 minutes then flip using metal tongs and cook 2 more minutes on the other side.
